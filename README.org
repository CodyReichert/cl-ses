* cl-ses - Send emails from Common Lisp with AWS's SES

  cl-ses is a simple, low footprint, Common Lisp package for sending
  email with AWS's SES.

** Usage
   cl-ses exports one simple =send-email= function:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (cl-ses:send-email :from "me@example.com"
                        :to "you@example.com"
                        :subject "Hello from CL-SES"
                        :message "The body of the email message"
                        :aws-access-key "XXXXXX"
                        :aws-secret-key "XXXXXXXXXXX")
   #+END_SRC

   =send-email= returns =T= if the status was 200 (OK), and =NIL=
   otherwise. In the future I'll hopefully have implemented better
   error reporting.


** Dependencies
   - [[http://weitz.de/drakma/][Drakma]] is the only external dependency

** Installation
   Right now this is only on GitHub, but if you use quicklisp it's
   still easy to include in a project:

   =git clone git@github.com:CodyReichert/cl-ses ~/quicklisp/local-projects=

   then you can:

   =(ql:quickload :cl-ses)=
