#+DESCRIPTION: Send emails from Common Lisp with AWS's SES


  cl-ses is a Common Lisp package for sending email with AWS's SES.


* Usage
   cl-ses exports the =send-email= function:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (cl-ses:send-email :from "me@example.com"
                        :to "you@example.com"
                        :subject "Hello from CL-SES"
                        :message "The body of the email message"
                        :aws-access-key "XXXXXX"
                        :aws-secret-key "XXXXXXXXXXX")
   #+END_SRC

   =send-email= returns =T= if the status was 200 (OK), and =NIL=
   otherwise. In the future I'll hopefully have implemented better
   error reporting.

** Setting the Content-Type
    There is support for setting the email's =Content-Type=. I've
    tested with =text/plain= and =text/html=, but others should work
    as well:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (cl-ses:send-email ...
                        ...
                        :content-type "text/html"
                        ...)
   #+END_SRC

    The content-type key is optional, and defaults to =text/plain=.

** Mulitple Recipients
   You can specify multiple recipients by using a comma separated list
   of email addresses:

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (cl-ses:send-email ...
                        :to "first@example.com,second@example.com"
                        ...
                        ...)
   #+END_SRC

** Setting a name in the from field
   This isn't really AWS Specific, but you can set a "Name" in the
   =from= parameter (you still need an email address):

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
     (cl-ses:send-email :from "My Name <me@example.com>"
                        ...
                        ...)
   #+END_SRC

* Dependencies
   - [[http://weitz.de/drakma/][Drakma]] is the only external dependency

* Installation
   Right now this is only on GitHub, but if you use quicklisp it's
   still easy to include in a project:

   =git clone git@github.com:CodyReichert/cl-ses ~/quicklisp/local-projects=

   then you can:

   =(ql:quickload :cl-ses)=
